Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning : Task 3 
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of
the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and
many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine
learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for
you.

Sales Prediction using Python: TASK 4
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on
factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to
predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
